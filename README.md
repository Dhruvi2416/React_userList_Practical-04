# User_List UI

It is a simple template that fetches user information from API with pagination.

**Getting Started:**

React is a JavaScript library, based on components which helps to create a friendly UI. This is a simple template where user data is fetched and displayed on a seperate card while hovering on it. Also has a pagination which will fetch different user data while navigating on different page.

**Prerequisites:**


npm (9.3.1 or above versions)

**Run the project locally**

Clone the project and install the dependencies:

$ Create a folder in editor

$ cd folder

$ git clone https://github.com/Dhruvi2416/React_userList_Practical-04.git


In the project directory, you can run following command for installing dependencies present in the package.json.


 **npm install** 

Runs the app in the development mode. By default, NODE_ENV is set to development

**npm start**

Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser. The page will reload if you make edits. You will also see any lint errors in the console.
Note: Port 3000 by default


Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.

**npm test**

Builds the app for production to the build folder. It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance. By default NODE_ENV is set to production. The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes. Your app is ready to be deployed! See the section about deployment for more information.
